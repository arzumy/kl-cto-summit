<p>We were put in this position mostly by necessity. One minute we were busy hammering the keyboard churning out code, next minute we had to interview our first subordinate. Before we know it, we had to lead a team of talented rogue engineers. </p>

<p>Yes, maybe we are good at controlling machines. But that doesn’t mean humans will respond the same way as the computers. It’s time for us to chat about this and figure it out.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-will-we-talk-about" class="anchor" href="#what-will-we-talk-about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What will we talk about?</h2>

<p>In this summit we will focus on hiring, firing, retention, and culture. We’ll get to share with our peers about their experience in scaling up the team, removing obstacle, and generally on how to run a world class engineering team.</p>

<p>Original write up from initial invite:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Last August I was lucky to be invited to Sequoia CTO Summit in Bangalore. I was blown away by it. There were so much you can learn when you put a bunch of CTOs in a room. But what I really appreciate is the objective of the summit itself - “By the end of the day, we hope you’ve made new friends that you can call when you need help.”</p>

<p>I hope to replicate this here in KL. Our tech ecosystem is relatively young. Most of us were shoved into CTO role by necessity. I remember my first CTO role, I had no clue on how to lead, I just know how to code. It was a disaster. Recently with KFit, I had the luxury to call few of tech leads from established startups to learn about strong mobile development, which was completely new to me. Thanks to their wisdom, we managed to avoid some big blunders.</p>

<a id="how-to-get-invited" class="anchor" href="#how-to-get-invited" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to get invited</h2>

<p>We’ve completed first round of invitations. Now we are limiting the seats to another 12 companies. We want to make sure we can build a meaningful friendships during the event. It’s easier to achieve this in a small group.</p>

<p>Yes we are calling it KL CTO Summit, but it’s not limited to CTOs. If you are leading an engineering team, then you are invited. Non-technical founders and recruiters are not invited, you have bunch of other events already :P</p>

<p>Just fill in this form, and we’ll get back to you: <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/R4NyOKRXFR">http://goo.gl/forms/R4NyOKRXFR</a></p>
